          to find frames corresponding to one of your reducers. That code should be refactored to \
          not invoke the effect directly.
          
          * The store has been sent actions from multiple threads. The `send` method is not \
          thread-safe, and should only ever be used from a single thread (typically the main \
          thread). Instead of calling `send` from multiple threads you should use effects to \
          process expensive computations on background threads so that it can be fed back into the \

     A version of scope that scope an collection of sub store.

     This is kinda a version of `ForEachStoreNode`, not composing `WithViewStore` but creates the sub store.

     ## Example
     ```
     struct AppState { var todos: [Todo] }
     struct AppAction { case todo(index: Int, action: TodoAction }

     store.subscribe(\.todos)
        .drive(onNext: { todos in

                )
            }
        })
        .disposed(by: disposeBag)
     ```

     But with example above, you created the entire node again and again and it's not the efficient way.
     You can do some diffing and only creating spesific index, and rest is handle by diffing.

     - Parameters:
        - identifier: the identifier from `IdentifierType` make sure index is in bounds of the collection
        - action: A function to transform `LocalAction` to `Action`. `LocalAction` should have `(CollectionIndex, LocalAction)` signature.

     - Returns: A new store with its domain (state and domain) transformed based on the index you set
